# Link-Up Hospital Application Research Documentation

## User Research: Summary
I conducted a secondary research to better understand the needs of hospitals and healthcare providers in regards to linking up with other healthcare institutions.
Through interviews and surveys, it became clear that many healthcare providers are open to the idea of linking up with other institutions to improve patient care and outcomes.<br>
However, the majority of providers reported feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about how to go about this process. Feedback received through research made it clear that users would be more willing to actively seek out and engage in partnerships if they had access to an easy-to-use tool that guides them through the process of finding and connecting with other healthcare institutions.

## Key Features
Based on the given objective, the application is intended to link up hospitals. In lieu to this, here are some potential key features of the MVP. These are:
* A searchable directory of hospitals
* Hospital profiles with basic information such as name, location, services offered, and contact details
* A messaging system to facilitate communication between hospitals

Since this is a proposal, more potential features can be added to guide the design.

The scope of the application will also be limited to these key features and any necessary supporting features (e.g. user authentication, data storage) to make the application functional.

## User Personas
To define user personas and their needs for the hospital application, I came up with a problem statement for each persona according to pain points identified:

**Persona 1**: Angela<br>
**Age**: 35<br>
**Occupation**: Nurse<br>
**Goal**: Angela wants a mobile app that will help her manage patient information and appointments easily, allowing her to provide better care to her patients.<br>
**Frustration**: Angela finds it difficult to keep track of patient schedules, medical histories and other vital information due to her busy work schedule.<br>
> "I want an app that can help me keep up with my patients, even when I'm not at work."

Angela is a dedicated nurse who works long hours in a busy hospital. She cares deeply about her patients and wants to provide them with the best care possible. However, with so many patients to keep track of, she often finds herself struggling to remember important details about their medical histories and appointments.

**Persona 2**: Michael<br>
**Age**: 45<br>
**Occupation**: Hospital Administrator<br>
**Goal**: Michael wants a mobile app that will help him manage his hospital's operations, including patient care, scheduling, and billing.<br>
**Frustration**: Michael finds it challenging to manage hospital operations efficiently due to the many moving parts involved.<br>
> "I need an app that can help me streamline hospital operations and make it easier for everyone to do their jobs."

Michael is a busy hospital administrator who is responsible for managing all aspects of hospital operations. He has to ensure that patients receive the best possible care, that staff are properly scheduled and trained, and that the hospital's finances are in order. It's a challenging job, and he often feels like there aren't enough hours in the day to get everything done.

**Persona 3**: Sarah<br>
**Age**: 28<br>
**Occupation**: Medical Resident<br>
**Goal**: Sarah wants a mobile app that will help her keep track of her patient's medical histories and test results, making it easier for her to provide effective treatment.<br>
**Frustration**: Sarah finds it challenging to keep track of her patient's medical histories, test results, and other vital information while working long hours in the hospital.<br>
> "I need an app that can help me provide the best possible care to my patients, even when I'm working long hours and feeling overwhelmed."

Sarah is a dedicated medical resident who wants to provide her patients with the best possible care. She works long hours in the hospital and often feels overwhelmed by the many demands of her job. She wants an app that will help her keep track of her patient's medical histories and test results, allowing her to provide more effective treatment.

---
**Persona 4**: Rhema<br>
**Age**: 45
**Occupation**: Teacher
**Goal**: Rhema wants to have easy access to the hospital's information and services. She wants to be able to book appointments, access her medical records, and receive updates on her treatment plan through the app.
**Frustrations**: Rhema is frustrated with long waiting times at the hospital, difficulty in booking appointments, and the lack of transparency in the hospital's services and procedures.
> "I want to be able to manage my health easily without having to go through a lot of hassle. The app should make my life easier, not more complicated."

Rhema has been recently diagnosed with a chronic condition and needs to manage her health carefully. She wants to stay on top of her appointments and treatment plan without having to constantly call the hospital. She downloads the Link-Up hospital app and finds it easy to navigate. She is able to book appointments quickly and view her medical records with ease. She appreciates the convenience and time-saving features of the app, which allows her to focus on her health without any additional stress.

## User Stories
From on the user personas and their needs, I was able to generate user stories to clearly define the functionality and features of the application:
1. As a **patient**, I want to be able to search for hospitals near my location.
3. As a **patient**, I want to be able to see the hospital’s ratings and reviews.
5. As a **patient**, I want to be able to book appointments with doctors in the hospital.
7. As a **doctor**, I want to be able to view my appointments for the day.
9. As a **hospital administrator**, I want to be able to manage the hospital’s information such as location, contact details and services provided.
11. As a **hospital administrator**, I want to be able to manage the hospital’s doctors and their schedules.
13. As a **hospital administrator**, I want to be able to view analytics such as the number of appointments per day, week or month.
15. As a **hospital administrator**, I want to be able to receive feedback from patients and respond to them.
<br>
These user stories can help guide the development of the application and ensure that it meets the needs of its users.

## Competitive Audit
An audit of a few competitor’s products provided direction on gaps and opportunities to address.

From researching and analyzing existing solutions to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement, here is a competitive audit for the Link-Up hospital app:
1. **Doximity**: <br>
Doximity is a social networking platform for healthcare professionals that allows doctors to connect with each other, share patient information securely, and collaborate on patient care.<br>
**Strengths**: a large and active user base, secure messaging and file sharing capabilities, and integration with other healthcare systems.<br>
**Weaknesses**: limited patient-facing features and a focus primarily on physician-to-physician communication rather than broader care coordination. <br>

2. **Health Gorilla**: <br>
Health Gorilla is an online platform that allows healthcare providers to order and receive diagnostic tests and other medical services, as well as share patient information with other providers. <br>
**Strengths**: a wide range of services available through the platform, integration with major lab and imaging companies, and strong security and privacy measures. <br> **Weaknesses**: a relatively high cost for some services and limited patient engagement and communication features. <br>

3. Cerner: <br>
Cerner is an EHR system used by hospitals and healthcare providers to manage patient records, schedule appointments, and communicate with other providers. <br>
**Strengths**: a robust feature set and customization options, strong security and compliance measures, and integration with other healthcare systems. <br>
**Weaknesses**: a steep learning curve for users, potential for data entry errors, and limited patient engagement features. <br>

4. Medici: <br>
Medici is a telemedicine platform that allows patients to connect with healthcare providers via secure messaging, video calls, and phone calls. <br>
**Strengths**: a user-friendly interface, flexible payment options, and strong security and privacy measures. <br>

**Weaknesses**: a lack of formal support options, potential security vulnerabilities, and a potentially steep learning curve for users. <br>

Based on this audit, Link-Up can differentiate itself by focusing on a patient-centered approach to care coordination, incorporating strong patient engagement and communication features, and providing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for healthcare providers.
